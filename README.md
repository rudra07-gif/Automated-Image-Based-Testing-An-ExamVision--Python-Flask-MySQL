# Automated-Image-Based-Testing-An-ExamVision--Python-Flask-MySQL
The script builds a complete image-based quiz application with user authentication, leveraging deep learning for image feature extraction and a MySQL database for storing user details and scores. The application starts by importing essential libraries such as NumPy, PIL for image manipulation, TensorFlow's VGG16 model for extracting image features, and MySQL connector for database operations. The AuthSystem class manages user registration, login, password hashing with SHA-256, score saving, and retrieval of score history, all through secure queries to a MySQL database. It ensures robust error handling and feedback to users using message boxes.

The AuthWindow class provides a GUI interface using Tkinter's ttk.Notebook with two tabs—Login and Register. It validates user input, checks password confirmation, and provides appropriate feedback for success or failure during registration and login. When a user logs in successfully, the control passes to the main ImageQuizApp class, which starts the quiz. This class initializes VGG16 without the top classification layer to extract image features from resized and preprocessed images (100x100 pixels). It also includes image processing functions to create bordered patches and merge them into a quiz layout.

During the quiz, the system randomly selects image patches from the provided directories, calculates similarity metrics (cosine similarity, SSIM, and Euclidean distance), and allows the user to pick the most similar image patch. Each question’s time is tracked, and the score is stored in the database after completion. The app also provides a clean user interface for viewing questions and interacting with the quiz using Tkinter. It ensures user-specific scoring data is stored and retrieved securely, allowing users to track their performance across sessions. Overall, the application integrates computer vision, machine learning, GUI design, and database management into one coherent system for educational or gamified learning purposes.
